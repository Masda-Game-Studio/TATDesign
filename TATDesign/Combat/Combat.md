The combat system is very interesting imo
At first i wanted to make it turn based because i wanted to let people with higher pings be able to play competitively  (it's a problem that i suffer myself :D).
But i found out that i don't have to make it turn based, we can just slow down the pace of the game, so instead of spamming buttons with little consequences for each decision, this game will be few actions with big consequences
I don't plan to make 10 abilities (including passives) for each set of gear.
You may think that it will simplify the game but i think the number of abilities wouldn't really add depth to the game, instead the way you use your few abilities in regard of the environment determines the depth of the game.
DOTA is a good example. you only have 4 abilities but it has a very deep combat system.
